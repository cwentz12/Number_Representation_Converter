This is a number representation converter written in Python. In the main menu, the user has the option to convert numbers written in 
any base 2-36 into any other base. For example, one menu option allows the user to convert a number in base 10 (decimal) into other common 
bases like base 2 (binary) and base 16 (hexadecimal). The user can also convert base 10 into base 3, or base 27, and so on. In addition, the user can convert
a number in any base into decimal, or another base of their choosing. There are also options to take a given number in a given base and convert it 
to all other bases 2-36 in one view. If a user is prompted to enter a number in a base that uses letters, it shows them all valid alphanumeric symbols
for the given base to create the number. 

My main purpose in writing this program was to come up with a generalized algorithm that could convert any number and base into any other base as opposed 
to some of the existing methods which can only convert decimal to binary, for example.
